## **Intro to Splunk**
The “Introduction to Splunk” course is, as the title suggests, is an introduction to the tools of Splunk and the possible uses for Splunk. The course starts off by explaining how Splunk can streamline causes for failure and aid in cybersecurity. It then delves into using their powerful search engine. One important thing to note is to always limit your searches based on the time they occurred; this helps massively with speed and limiting undesired events. It then goes into some powerful commands to help tailor searches, such as the use of an asterisk (*) and the following Boolean operators: AND, OR, and NOT. The training then delves into knowledge objects; Knowledge objects are tools that help discover and analyze data. They aid with data interpretation, data classification, data enrichment, data models, and data normalization. They are helpful as they can be shared and reused, as well as used in a search. Splunk also allows for reports to be created. These are useful in summarizing and visualizing the data from the searches. This allows for insights and interpretations to be made from the data to aid in future decision making to avoid the weaknesses that led to the possible incident. The training lastly talks about dashboards which are displays that present integrated data for monitoring and analysis. The Dashboard Studio is an interface which allows users to create and customize the dashboards for better data representation.
