## **Research a Security Tool: bettercap**
The security tool I chose to investigate was bettercap as I wanted to learn more about a man in the middle attack. Bettercap is an open-source tool used for network scanning, analysis, and penetration testing. Bettercap is written in Go which is a statically typed, compiled programming language developed by Google. Bettercap is platform-independent meaning that it supports GNU/Linux, BSD, Android, Apple macOS and the Microsoft Windows operating systems. The links where bettercap can be downloaded are listed below in the "Download Links" section.
