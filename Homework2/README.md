## **Finding Docker Images**
1. Docker container for the new Datadog Agent. The organization behind this container is Datadog. There are two image variants: the first variant embeds a Java Runtime Environment for JMX-based checks. It is recommended to use this one if you are unsure which one to use. The other variant does not embed a Java runtime and would be used if not using JMX-based checks since it is slimmer. There are also two supported versions: Agent 7 which includes a Python 3 interpreter, and Agent 6 which includes a Python 2 interpreter. The two agents have different relevant tags. <br />
